#The down-amount option is a bit tricky to explain.
#In alwaysonline, it will run a process every so often to check if the session server are offline.
#This speed on how often it does it is defined by the check-interval option.
#If the session servers are offline, we increment an integer variable by one.
#If the variable reaches the number defined in the down-amount option, we declare the session server to be offline.
#While offline, the process will then determine if the session servers are online.
#When the session servers are online again, the variable is reset to zero and awaits until the session server becomes offline again.
