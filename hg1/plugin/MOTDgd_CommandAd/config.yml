#If the plugin doesn't work correctly, please make sure that you have installed all the libraries correctly (NON-cauldron users).
#We INCLUDE all required libraries in our zip download file automatically - all you need to do is extract the zip & its contents to your plugin folder.
#For CAULDRON users - there is a dedicated download available on our plugin page for you (don't worry about libraries).

#The plugin will automatically detect if you are missing libraries and notify you with this message:
#
#[ERROR] Failed to enable CommandAd. Could not find library: + library name
#[ERROR] Please make sure that you downloaded and installed all dependencies.
#
# Don't FORGET to DEOP yourself when you test this plugin - OPs are IMMUNE by default & CHECK you downloaded the RIGHT version for your server.
# You CAN use "careloadconf" on your server console to update this config file so you DON'T have to restart your server whenever you make changes.

#REMINDER INTERVALS
#===================================================================================================================================================================#
#Reminders simply remind people to view ads on your server.
#Reminders typically include "reminder-message" and "link-message" (see the messages section to customise them).

#There are 3 types of reminder you can implement on your server:

#REMINDER-DELAY
#The amount of time between two reminder messages in MINUTES (these remind players to watch an ad if they haven't done so).
#If you use our command "careloadconf" on the server console to reset your config file - it won't update THIS command (a server restart is needed).
#Set this to "0" to disable this reminder.
reminder-delay: 5

#MESSAGES-BEFORE-REMINDER
#The number of messages that should be sent in the game chat before the server issues a reminder to users who have not viewed ads.
#You should think about the popularity of your server here, if the number you enter is too low you risk annoying users.
#Set this to "0" to disable this reminder.
messages-before-reminder: 20

#BLOCK-REMINDER-AMOUNT
#This ONLY applies if you used our custom command to stop users breaking blocks on join, and they haven't yet watched an ad (in order to break blocks).
#The number specifies how many blocks they should attempt to break unsuccessfully before you remind them they need to watch an ad.
#Set this to "0" to disable this reminder.
blocksbreak-before-reminder: 5

#TIP - In addition to the above reminders, users can also do /getadlink at any time if the ad link disappears from their chat (when not on a cooldown period).

#MESSAGES
#===================================================================================================================================================================#
#You should put all your messages between quotes e.g. "my message here"
#Colour codes are supported in all messages http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes)
#You can colour your messages using & or # and the appropriate number e.g. &2 is a colour code for Dark Green. 
#Example: "&2 Hello and welcome to my server" will appear in Dark Green as "Hello and welcome to my server"

#If you want to use the & or # characters as part of the actual text in your messages and NOT as colour codes, put "\\" before them.
#Example: "&2 Welcome \\& have fun!" will appear in Dark Green as "Welcome & have fun!"


#The message a player will see on join if they're not on cooldown.
before-ad-message: "&2Welcome to the server, please watch this ad to support the &2community \\& get a reward."

#The message that will open an advertisement when clicked - this will be shown on join and alongside all reminder messages you set.
link-message: "&3Click here to watch an ad!"

#The message a player will see when they have finished watching an ad if they're not on cooldown.
after-ad-message: "Thanks for watching the ad, here's your reward!"

#The reminder message sent to a player who has not yet watched an ad.
#The delay of the reminder message is configurable in the reminders section.
reminder-message: "Don't forget to watch the ad!"

#This message only applies if you used our custom command to stop users breaking blocks on join, and they haven't yet watched an ad (in order to break blocks).
#This message will be sent users when they try and break blocks unsuccessfully - you can specify how many blocks they have to try and break before it appears in the reminders section.
block-reminder-message: "Don't forget to watch an ad to break blocks"

#The message a player will see when they go onto a cooldown period from watching ads (a cooldown period means they don't benefit from watching your ads).
#If you're using cooldown, the string <cooldown> will be automatically replaced with the correct cooldown duration.
#NOTE: If you are not using a cooldown on your server, leave this message blank!
advert-cooldown-message: "You are now on a cooldown of <cooldown> minutes."


#===================================================================================================================================================================#
#ADVERT-COOLDOWN
#The amount of time in minutes a player will be on cooldown, after they watch an ad (a cooldown period means they don't benefit from watching your ads).
#Cooldowns will still apply by default even if you restart the server (unless they expire or they're manually cleared).
#If you use our command "careloadconf" on the server console to reset your config file - it won't update THIS command (a server restart is needed).
#Put "0" to disable this, if you do, please leave the advert-cooldown-message (in the messages section) empty as well.
advert-cooldown: 5

#TIP - Cooldowns can be cleared manually by ops with in-game commands:
#/clearadcooldown [username] to clear the cooldown of a specific player
#/clearglobaladcooldown to clear the cooldown of all online players that are on cooldown.

#TIP - The command "/cooldown" will allow your individual players to see how much time they have left on their cooldown periods.


#RANDOM-COMMAND
#If set to true, only one random command from the after-ad-command list will be executed, like a dice roll.
#If set to false all the commands after the after-ad command list will be executed.
random-command: false

#COMMANDS
#===================================================================================================================================================================#
#All commands are dispatched by the console (you can use any custom/MC command). To specify a player use the "<player>" tag.
#E.G. give <player> apple 1 to give one apple to a player that just joined.

#It is possible to perform multiple commands, simply make a list, like these EXAMPLES:

# EXAMPLE ONLY:
#before-ad-command-with-cooldown:
#  1: give <player> apple 1
#  2: msg <player> Welcome to the server, watch an ad to get a diamond & break blocks!
#  3: disableblockbreak <player>

#TIP - IF you disable block breaking with our optional custom command - we HIGHLY recommend you do it on the "before-ad-command-with cooldown" list.

# EXAMPLE ONLY:
#after-ad-command-with-cooldown:
#  1: give <player> diamond 1
#  2: msg <player> Thanks for supporting our community, here's your diamond - you can now break blocks!
#  3: enableblockbreak <player>


#IMPORTANT tips:
#Tip: Check all the commands you choose, run with your version of Minecraft e.g. "msg" isn't a command on 1.8 versions (1.8 uses "tell" instead).
#Tip: If you're running Minecraft versions older than 1.8 then you may need to use item DEX numbers instead of item words e.g. 273 instead of stone_shovel.
#Tip: Here is a useful link containing item names and DEX numbers - http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_values/Item_IDs
#Tip: If you use our custom break blocks command, and the user cannot break blocks after an ad - CHECK they aren't in the "spawn protection" area or disable this protection.
#Tip: Make sure the commands are put after the list number(s) i.e. 1: give <player> diamond 1
#Tip: You can add subsequent commands by adding more numbers on new lines (see our examples further up).


#NOT AFFECTED BY COOLDOWN
#The command(s) that will be performed when a player joins the server, ALWAYS regardless of whether they are on a cooldown or NOT.
before-ad-command-without-cooldown:
  1:

#AFFECTED BY COOLDOWN
#The command(s) that will be performed when a player joins the server, ONLY if they are NOT on a cooldown period. 
#If the player is ON a cooldown these commands WON'T be performed on join.
#If you choose to disable block breaking with our optional custom command (see examples up the page), we STRONGLY suggest you do that HERE.
before-ad-command-with-cooldown:
  1:
  
  
#AFFECTED BY COOLDOWN 
#The command(s) that will be performed when a player watches an ad (i.e. they stay on the ad page until the page timer runs out/ad finishes).
#These commands WILL be affected by cooldown; if the player is on cooldown, these commands WILL NOT be performed again until their cooldown ends.

#IMPORTANT NOTES
#A video advert sometimes isn't available, due to fill rate fluctuation (video ad campaign availability in a particular country) - this changes throughout the year, sometimes your players will just see a loading screen (due to no video ad being available).
#If a player can't see a video ad it's NOT broken, we will at LEAST try to show them a banner/remnant ad (classed as non-video on the member's portal), these pay you "something" rather than "nothing" - so don't panic about rewarding users who don't always get video ads.
#If a user is using an "adblock" extension etc. - we won't show them an advert/reward them until they disable it.
#Enjoy - MOTDgd started in July 2013, and we have a great track record and experience in the games industry, thanks for choosing us to support your Minecraft Server :)
