# You need to register your custom biomes here. This setting will make Terrain Control
# generate setting files for them. However, it won't place them in the world automatically.
# See the settings for your BiomeMode below on how to add them to the world.

# Syntax: CustomBiomes:BiomeName:id[,AnotherBiomeName:id[,...]]
# Example: CustomBiomes:TestBiome1:30,BiomeTest2:31
# This will add two biomes and generate the BiomeConfigs for them.
# All changes here need a server restart.

# Due to the way Mojang's loading code works, all biome ids need to be unique
# on the server. If you don't do this, the client will display the biomes just fine,
# but the server can think it is another biome with the same id. This will cause saplings,
# snowfall and mobs to work as in the other biome.

# The available ids range from 0 to 255 and the ids 0-39 and 129-167 are taken by vanilla.
# Avoid those ids for your custom biomes.
